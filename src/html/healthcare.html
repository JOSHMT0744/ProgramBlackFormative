            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading1">Medical and Patient Data</h4>
            <p>
                When examining patients, doctors and nurses can take notes and prescribe treatments at the point of care. 
                This eliminates a lot of potential for mistakes from personnel trying to read handwriting or trying to remember the situation later on. 
                It also adds efficiency because doctors and nurses can enter pertinent information on the spot.
            </p>
            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading2">Medical Imaging and Equipment</h4>
            <p>
                Medical PCs are often used to control medical devices that perform CT Scans, ultrasounds, MRIs, or blood tests. 
                They can even be integrated into the equipment itself, saving space. 
                Additionally, doctors and nurses are able to show patients their X-Rays and other images or videos to explain 
                their condition and treatment
            </p>
            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">Inventory</h4>
            <p>
                Knowing what medications are in stock is crucial for patient treatment. Therefore, keeping inventory lists up to date is very important.
                If a doctor prescribes something that is not in stock without knowing, they could slow down recovery. 
                Instead, using a computer to track inventory would alert the staff immediately when something is wrong so they can change 
                their treatment plan if needed.
            </p>
            <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4">Research</h4>
            <p>
                Computers in the healthcare field have vastly increased the amount of knowledge that medical staff can access. 
                Doctors can consult medical databases to learn more about a specific disease or treatment plan. 
                Computers can run simulations to try and find causes and cures for diseases and work with other machines to increase 
                the chance of success.
